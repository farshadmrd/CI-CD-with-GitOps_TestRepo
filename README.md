The project proposed consists of defining and implementing an automatic pipeline with 3 stages based on the GitOps framework used to:
- build a simple micro-services application using the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/) framework
- execute smoke tests on the application
- release application directly on a server in a simulated customer premises

This project must use tools such as [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) to build this pipeline.
